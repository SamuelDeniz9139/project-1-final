- Added code in handleResponse that gets the values of the snowman parts
chosen by the user and the names of the respective snowman. Since the
part types will always align with themselves, the type of part isn't
as important to get.
- Added scarf and buttons as changable options for the snowman.

2/26/2022:
- Created custom images for most of the different parts that can be worn
by the snowman. They are read in by the main page and now appear when
the user asks to see the snowmen.
- Made a special function to make the scarf color display. If the scarf
color was set to "none", no scarf will appear on the snowman.
- Implemented embedded font that was absent from the prototype.
